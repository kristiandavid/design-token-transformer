# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Design Tokens Transformation

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the main branch
on:
  repository_dispatch:
    # and the event_type property from the request body is 'update-tokens'
    types: update-tokens

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # the name for the entire job
